## Files descriptions

'ARC2_Qoura_Clark_5FOLD.py' - is for generation 5 fold cross validation data for BIMPM model on training set.

'ARC_2_Quora_Clark_Justification.py' - is for generating BIMPM input data filtered at different P values as discussed in the submission.


'Evaluate_BIMPM_calculate_overlap_EA.py' - is used for evaluating BIMPM output. Since BIMPM model generated predictions of randomized questions due to batching, we have to rearrange and sort the correct sequence of candidate answers and questions.


'main_Feedforward_Ensemble_Challenge.py' - is for generating input to meta-ensemble for ARC's challenge set

'main_Feedforward_Ensemble.py' - - is for generating input to meta-ensemble for ARC's Easy set

'Feedforward_PMI_multi_class.py' - has the feedforward model for meta-ensemble
